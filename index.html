   <h2>My Tech Goals for the next 2 years</h2>
   <p>Over the next two years, my primary objective is to become a proficient full-stack developer and complete at least two
   high-quality full-stack projects. Currently, I have a solid foundation in React and possess one frontend portfolio
   project. As I aim and until I can secure a frontend development job that will significantly occupy my time, my main goal
   is to continue expanding my knowledge and skills with the learning path I have set for myself below:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Advanced React: Deepen my expertise in React.js to build more complex and dynamic user interfaces.</li>
    <li>Node.js: Acquire proficiency in Node.js to handle server-side development effectively.</li>
    <li>Databases: Gain a thorough understanding of database management systems to ensure robust backend development.</li>
    <li>Next.js: Learn Next.js to enhance my ability to create optimized and scalable web applications.</li>
    <li>TypeScript: Integrate TypeScript into my development process to improve code quality and maintainability.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>
    While learning these technologies, I aim to develop outstanding websites that will showcase my skills and help me stand
    out from my peers. By building impressive projects, I will ensure that my portfolio reflects my capabilities as a
    full-stack developer. I am committed to continue learning and developing projects until I fulfil my dream of being a full stack developer.
